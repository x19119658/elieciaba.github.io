    <p>Dear Hiring Manage</p>
    <p>I am writing to express my interest in the position of GMP Lab Systems Engineer at [Company Name]. With over five
      years of experience in laboratory systems management and validation within highly regulated pharmaceutical
      environments, I am confident that my technical expertise, regulatory knowledge, and problem-solving abilities
      would make me a valuable asset to your team.</p>
    <p>In my current role at [Current Company Name], I have been responsible for the implementation, qualification, and
      maintenance of GxP-compliant laboratory systems, including LIMS, Empower, and other analytical software. My work
      ensures full data integrity compliance in line with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11, and company SOPs. I have
      successfully led multiple system validation projects from concept through to operational qualification,
      collaborating closely with QA, IT, and laboratory teams to maintain system reliability and audit readiness.</p>
    <p>I take pride in my ability to bridge the gap between technical IT functionality and GMP compliance, ensuring that
      system changes, upgrades, and integrations are delivered efficiently without compromising regulatory standards. My
      background also includes drafting and reviewing validation documentation (URS, DQ, IQ, OQ, PQ), managing
      deviations and CAPAs, and supporting both internal and external audits.</p>
    <p>I am particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of its commitment to innovation and quality in pharmaceutical
      manufacturing. I am eager to contribute my technical experience and regulatory insight to help sustain and further
      enhance your laboratory systems’ compliance and performance.</p>
    <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your organisation’s goals.
      Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely</p>
